Daily Progress
March 16th, 2023

Today I did the following:
1. Did some research on Top-Down vs Bottom-Up learning. I generated a handful of case studies and saved to google drive.
2. Revised my development timeline - replaced any repeat tasks with a "buffer day" in my timeline.
3. Requested review of the Development Timeline on reddit. Unsure if I'll get any bites
4. Formatted the timeline and outline, adding links as needed.
5. Made my first Git repo with actual Git - this took a little while. In doing so, I had a couple of issues:
---- I had to redownload Xcode
---- I had to alter my GitHub because I accidentally published my secret_key (whoops)
---- Eventually I learned about the .env file and put my key in there with "config"
---- Then I tried to uncommit and amend the commit, but it wasn't possible. 
---- In the end, I deleted and reuploaded and all worked well!!
6. After that, I started working on the PostgreSQL database. This gave me a lot of trouble. Here's some problems I ran into and how I solved them:
---- I couldn't figure out my password. Had to fix by going into PyAdmin4 and setting up the admin password and my own user login.
---- bash couldn't find the commands. I didn't want to have to copy and paste the full path of every command, so I tried to fix it! 
---- I put the PATH in a ~/.bashrc file and then used source ~/.bashrc to download the changes. (I had to research how to copy a folder path though. CTRL + CMD + C fyi)
7. It worked and I was so happy!!!
8. Then I updated the settings.py file with the database information. I used the same .env file and config to input my PSQL username and password to make it more secure! 
9. Ran migrate.py

Currently, it's about 3:45 and I'm really running out of steam. The next thing I need to do is actually create the database and tables. I'm not sure if I want to do this today because my brain i literally mush and I'm soooooooo hungry! I was also up super late last night. I might sign off for the day. Yeah, I'm signing off.
